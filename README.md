# Project1
A To Do List that used HTML/CSS and Javascript


This project allowed me to learn and put to practice some concepts that i learned such like DOM manipulation, functions, and to renew some of HTML/CSS concepts to keep them fresh.
Its a simple project but a powerful one that served his porpuse to keep to practice the theory i learned before!
